[Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) is a
Firefox Add-on which allows us to modify CSS of any websites we visit.

[Pantip.com](https://pantip.com/) is a Thai website which, currently (as
of Oct 5, 2017), uses a theme which has dark background color which is
not friendly with Dasung PaperLike Pro monitor.

[Dasung PaperLike Pro monitor](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/e-ink-monitor-with-hdmi-paperlike-pro#/)
is a monitor with e-ink screen.  Hence, it does not go well with dark
background, but, instead, it goes well with white background color and
black font color.

This Style Sheet for Stylish modifies Pantip.com's CSS to have white
background color and black font color so we could use Dasung PaperLike
Pro monitor to read contents on Pantip.com properly.
